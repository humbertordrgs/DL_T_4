# Task 4: Convolutional neural networks <br/> CC6204 Deep Learning, Universidad de Chile  <br/>
### Name: Humberto Rodrigues 

This project is the fourth part of the Quickstart to Neural Networks using Pytorch. In this, we will be exploring the most common and classic convolutional network models and testing them in important tasks of computational vision like `Image classification` and `Image captioning`.
